excerpt: "While teleoperation provides a possibility for a
robot to operate at extreme conditions instead of a human,
teleoperating a robot still demands a heavy mental workload
from a human operator. Learning from demonstrations can
reduce the human operator’s burden by learning repetitive
teleoperation tasks. However, one of challenging issues is that
demonstrations via teleoperation are less consistent compared
to other modalities of human demonstrations. In order to
solve this problem, we propose a learning scheme based on
Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) which can handle less
consistent, asynchronized and incomplete demonstrations. In
particular we proposed a new Expectation Maximization (EM)
algorithm which can synchronize and encode demonstrations
with temporal and spatial variances, different initial and final
conditions and partial executions. The proposed algorithm is
tested and validated with three different experiments of a pegin-hole task conducted on 3-Degree of freedom (DOF) masterslave teleoperation system."

### Abstract
While teleoperation provides a possibility for a
robot to operate at extreme conditions instead of a human,
teleoperating a robot still demands a heavy mental workload
from a human operator. Learning from demonstrations can
reduce the human operator’s burden by learning repetitive
teleoperation tasks. However, one of challenging issues is that
demonstrations via teleoperation are less consistent compared
to other modalities of human demonstrations. In order to
solve this problem, we propose a learning scheme based on
Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) which can handle less
consistent, asynchronized and incomplete demonstrations. In
particular we proposed a new Expectation Maximization (EM)
algorithm which can synchronize and encode demonstrations
with temporal and spatial variances, different initial and final
conditions and partial executions. The proposed algorithm is
tested and validated with three different experiments of a pegin-hole task conducted on 3-Degree of freedom (DOF) masterslave teleoperation system.
