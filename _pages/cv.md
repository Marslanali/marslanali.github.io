## Experience 

**Software Engineer (April 2021 - Present)**<br>
*Afiniti*<br>

* Part of Afiniti Switch Interface Team to pair sales or service agents with customers in both voice and digital channels by identifying valuable patterns of human interaction. The improved customer experience created through this one-to-one paring is measurable and directly increases the revenue for clients including British Telecom, Concentrix, United Health Group, Caesars, and Sky.
* Developed mapping and routing solution which successfully routes 10k call load (3 calls per second). Actively utilizes C++ REST SDK, HTTP request handling and C++ multi-threading.
* Develop TCP-based multi-threaded server application in C++ which process 10k client requests.
* Develop C++ service to interface with REST API and publish Switch Interface Schema to configuration servers.
* Create and improve REST client in C++ for a Switch Interface (Genesys PureConnect) that accesses Genesys data resources, manages connections with the IC server, specifies authentication and station settings, watches for connection state-change events, and performs actions relative to the connected session user.
* Analyze and test Genesys Interaction Center Web Services (ICWS) RESTful API’s for Afiniti integration with switch interface.
* Working closely with solution integration, deployment, DevOps and QA teams for the design and development of solutions to meet client requirements for the functionality and performance.

**Softawre Engineer/Consultant (March 2020 - April 2021)**<br>
*Zortik Technologies*<br>

* Analyze and Develop Network Intelligence and Security Engine (NISE) validation modules in C++ and Linux.
* Performed unit testing with GTest framework, memory profiling with Valgrind, and generated flame graphs for CPU utilization with open-source Linux tools.
* Analyze and develop machine learning model in C++ for measuring video quality of experience, achieved 93.5% and 91.8% predicted score for encrypted and unencrypted video respectively.

**Research Assistant/Associate (February 2020 - April 2021)**<br>
*National Center for Robotics and Automation (NCRA)*<br>
* Develop and analyze software-in-the-loop simulations for unmanned aerial & ground vehicles in C++ and Linux.
* Arslan Ali, M. Muzamil, Ans H. Qureshi, M. Mansoor Shukar,and Haroon Yousaf ”A Decentralized Formation Control Approch for Swarm of UAV” IEEE ICRAI 2021, Islamabad, Pakistan. (Best Session Paper Award)
