## Introduction

Software Engineer, passionate about designing and building innovative technologies using modern object-oriented languages
such as C++, C#, or Java. Excellent written and verbal communication skills, team player, interested in volunteer
activities, and fond of outdoor games.

Currently, I am part of Afiniti Switch Interface Team to pair sales or service agents with customers in both voice and digital channels by identifying valuable patterns of human interaction. The improved customer experience created through this one-to-one
paring is measurable and directly increases the revenue for clients including British Telecom, Concentrix, United Health
Group, Caesars, and Sky.
