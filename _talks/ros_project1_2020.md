### [2022] Analyze and test Genesys Interaction Center Web Services (ICWS) RESTful API’s for Afiniti integration with switch interface. 

Developed REST client in C++ for a Switch Interface (Genesys PureConnect) that accesses Genesys data
resources, manages connections with the IC server, specifies authentication and station settings, watches for connection
state-change events, and performs actions relative to the connected session user.


### [2021] Develop a Machine Learning Model (Random Forest) For Measuring Video Quality of Experience (QoE) in Encrypted Traffic. 

This project addresses the challenges of estimating the Quality of Experience (QoE) in encrypted traffic. Popular video providers such as YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney, and Vimeo have mostly encrypted video traffic and this poses additional challenges for the network operator to perform essentials tasks to inspect compressor balance traffic. We address the aforementioned problem using a machine learning model that predicts video QoE from encrypted traffic. We have selected a random forest classifier and trained model in python using the scikit-learn. The learned model is imported in C++ using the python scikit-learn porter library. The proposed machine learning models in C++ were able to identify quality issues from encrypted data with an accuracy of 90.5% for a range of encrypted video services with real-time traffic.

### Novel Learning from Demonstration Approach For Repetitive Teleoperation Tasks . [[Publication Link](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1364695/document.pdf)]

The project is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program (10069072) MOTIE, South Korea.
Done in Collaboration with Human Assistive Robotics Group at TUM, Germany, published in 2017 IEEE World Haptics Conference Munich, Germany, and ranked top 10%..

Abstract:
While teleoperation provides a possibility for a
robot to operate at extreme conditions instead of a human,
teleoperating a robot still demands a heavy mental workload
from a human operator. Learning from demonstrations can
reduce the human operator’s burden by learning repetitive
teleoperation tasks. However, one of challenging issues is that
demonstrations via teleoperation are less consistent compared
to other modalities of human demonstrations. In order to
solve this problem, we propose a learning scheme based on
Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) which can handle less
consistent, asynchronized and incomplete demonstrations. In
particular we proposed a new Expectation Maximization (EM)
algorithm which can synchronize and encode demonstrations
with temporal and spatial variances, different initial and final
conditions and partial executions. The proposed algorithm is
tested and validated with three different experiments of a pegin-hole task conducted on 3-Degree of freedom (DOF) masterslave teleoperation system.
